Write a program in Java for below questions:
1.How do you remove all white spaces from a string in java?
2.How to find largest number less than a given number and without a given digit?
Write a java program to find the largest number ‘L’ less than a given number ‘N’ which should not contain a given digit ‘D’. For example, If 145 is the given number and 4 is the given digit, then you should find the largest number less than 145 such that it should not contain 4 in it. 
In this case, 139 will be the answer.
3.How to check whether given number is binary or not?
A binary number is a number which contains only 0 or 1. 
For example : 101101, 110010110, 10010011 are binary numbers. 
4.How to separate zeros from non-zeros in an array?
For example, if {14, 0, 5, 2, 0, 3, 0} is the given array, 
then moving zeros to end of the array will result {14, 5, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0} and 
bringing zeros to front will result {0, 0, 0, 14, 5, 2, 3}
5.Reverse the string with preserving the position of spaces.
For example, if “I Am Not String” is the given string then the reverse of 
this string with preserving the position of spaces is “g ni rtS toNmAI”
6.Write a java program to find roman equivalent of a decimal number. 
7.Write a java program to find all permutations of a string recursively. 
For example, all permutations of string “JSP“ are,

JSP
JPS
SJP
SPJ
PJS
PSJ


8.Fizzbuzz is a fun game . It is simple game in which when your turn comes, 
you need to say the next number. So here are rules of the game:

If number is divisible by 3, then you need to say Fizz
If number is divisible by 5, then you need to say Buzz
If number is divisible by 3 and 5 both, then you need to say FizzBuzz
Else you just need to say next number
